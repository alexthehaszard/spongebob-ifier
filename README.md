## how to get it working locally

1: server

1. install deno to your machine

2. clone the repo on to your local machine

3. cd into the server folder and run command "deno run --allow-web index.ts"

2: client

1. cd into the client folder

2. run a web server using anything you want (i used python cause it's easy) on localhost:8000 (if you want to use a different address you have to change the address in the index.ts file so that it recognises your client)
